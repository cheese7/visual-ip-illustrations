# Visual IP Routing

This file defines visual-IP selection rules and verifiable route metadata for the skill entrypoint. `SKILL.md` selects the visual IP first, then loads only the selected route's reference files.

## Route Selection Rules

- Omitted visual IP selects `xiaohei`.
- `小黑`, `Xiaohei`, `Ian`, and `ian-xiaohei` select the same `xiaohei` route.
- `小盒`, `Littlebox`, `纸盒`, `paper-box`, and `carton` select the same `littlebox` route.
- `Tom`, `Tom Cat`, `Tom and Jerry`, `汤姆`, and `汤姆猫` select the same `tom` route and keep route status `gated-authorized`.
- `Ferris`, `Rust mascot`, `Rust crab`, `Rustacean`, `Rust 吉祥物`, and `Rust 螃蟹` select the same `ferris` route and keep route status `source-reviewed`.
- `Seal`, `hoodie seal`, `white seal`, `blue hoodie seal`, `海豹`, `连帽衫海豹`, `白色海豹`, and `蓝色连帽衫海豹` select the same `seal` route and keep route status `active`.
- `OpenClaw`, `openclaw`, `OpenClaw logo`, `OpenClaw mascot`, `OpenClaw 助手`, and `OpenClaw 吉祥物` select the same `openclaw` route and keep route status `source-reviewed`.
- `Go Gopher`, `Gopher`, `golang gopher`, `Go mascot`, `Go 吉祥物`, and `Gopher 吉祥物` select the same `gopher` route and keep route status `source-reviewed`.
- Go Gopher route matching requires Go Gopher, Gopher, golang gopher, or a Go Gopher-qualified route phrase; generic aliases such as `go`, `blue mascot`, `animal`, and `logo` remain outside the Go Gopher alias set.
- `蔡徐坤`, `Cai Xukun`, `caixukun`, and `cxk` select the same `caixukun` route and keep route status `gated-public-figure`.
- Cai Xukun route matching requires `蔡徐坤`, `Cai Xukun`, `caixukun`, or `cxk`; broad celebrity, idol, duck, yellow mascot, and fandom words remain outside the Cai Xukun alias set.
- `Hermes Agent`, `Hermes`, `hermes`, `hermes-agent`, `Hermes logo`, and `Hermes Agent logo` select the same `hermes` route and keep route status `source-reviewed`.
- Hermes Agent route matching requires `Hermes Agent`, `Hermes`, `hermes`, `hermes-agent`, `Hermes logo`, or `Hermes Agent logo`; broad assistant, AI agent, logo, anime, monochrome girl, fashion figure, Greek messenger, winged sandals, and caduceus terms remain outside the Phase 48 Hermes alias set.
- `Linux Mascot`, `Linux mascot`, `Linux`, `linux`, `Tux`, `tux`, `Linux penguin`, and `Tux penguin` select the same `linux` route and keep route status `source-reviewed`.
- Linux Mascot route matching requires `Linux Mascot`, `Linux mascot`, `Linux`, `linux`, `Tux`, `tux`, `Linux penguin`, or `Tux penguin`; broad penguin, server, kernel, distro, distro-logo, Linux Foundation, operating-system, CLI, terminal, product, brand-campaign, and generic mascot terms remain outside the Phase 53 Linux Mascot alias set.
- Mixed requests across Xiaohei, Littlebox, Tom, Ferris, Seal, OpenClaw, Go Gopher, Cai Xukun, Hermes Agent, and Linux Mascot create separate route groups. Compatibility marker: 每个 route group 只加载自己的 `required_references`; each group writes to its own output directory.
- Routes store only selection, references, output suffixes, and attribution context. Style, character identity, prompt wording, and QA rules live in the selected IP's reference files.
- Ferris is an explicit Rust-community mascot route with status source-reviewed; generated public Ferris samples require release review for Rust trademark and endorsement-safe wording.
- Ferris route-local reference directory: `skills/visual-ip-illustrations/references/ips/ferris/`.
- Ferris source/trademark authority: `skills/visual-ip-illustrations/references/ips/ferris/source.md`.
- Seal is an explicit hoodie seal route with status active; generated public Seal samples require release review for hoodie seal identity and no-logo mascot identity.
- Seal route-local reference directory: `skills/visual-ip-illustrations/references/ips/seal/`.
- Seal source-history authority: `skills/visual-ip-illustrations/references/ips/seal/source.md`.
- OpenClaw is an explicit source-reviewed logo-mascot route; generated public OpenClaw samples require release review for uploaded-logo identity and source/license authority.
- OpenClaw route-local reference directory: `skills/visual-ip-illustrations/references/ips/openclaw/`.
- OpenClaw source and uploaded-logo authority: `skills/visual-ip-illustrations/references/ips/openclaw/source.md`.
- Go Gopher is an explicit source-reviewed article-illustration mascot route; generated public Go Gopher samples require release review for Go blog source context, Renee French attribution, Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 license boundary, route-local `skills/visual-ip-illustrations/references/ips/gopher/gopher.png` visual authority, Go logo boundary, and official Go project affiliation, approval, sponsorship, and endorsement claim boundaries.
- Go Gopher route-local reference directory: `skills/visual-ip-illustrations/references/ips/gopher/`.
- Go Gopher source and local visual authority: `skills/visual-ip-illustrations/references/ips/gopher/source.md`.
- Cai Xukun is an explicit gated-public-figure stylized mascot article-illustration route; generated public Cai Xukun samples require release review for route-local uploaded visual authority recorded in `references/ips/caixukun/source.md` as uploaded reference image A and uploaded reference image B, public-figure likeness boundary, stylized mascot route framing, and realistic-person portrait output, official endorsement, affiliation, impersonation, campaign, celebrity advertising, and fandom promotion claim boundaries.
- Cai Xukun route-local reference directory: `skills/visual-ip-illustrations/references/ips/caixukun/`.
- Cai Xukun source and uploaded-image authority: `skills/visual-ip-illustrations/references/ips/caixukun/source.md`.
- Hermes Agent is an explicit source-reviewed uploaded-image article-illustration route; generated public Hermes samples require release review for official Hermes Agent context, MIT license context, uploaded-image authority from conversation attachment `Generated image 1 (16).jpeg`, product-poster output boundary, mythology-drift boundary, and official endorsement, affiliation, sponsorship, approval, and impersonation claim boundaries.
- Hermes Agent route-local reference directory: `skills/visual-ip-illustrations/references/ips/hermes/`.
- Hermes Agent source and uploaded-image authority: `skills/visual-ip-illustrations/references/ips/hermes/source.md`.
- Linux Mascot is an explicit source-reviewed uploaded-image article-illustration route; generated public Linux Mascot samples require release review for Larry Ewing Tux attribution, The GIMP attribution condition, Linux Foundation trademark guidance, Linux mark ownership context, uploaded local image authority `/Users/longnv/Downloads/Linux-logo.jpg`, distro-logo boundary, and official endorsement, certification, compatibility, Linux Foundation logo use, product-poster output, CLI screenshots, web hero graphics, kernel dashboard screenshots, and operating-system marketing graphics boundaries.
- Linux Mascot route-local reference directory: `skills/visual-ip-illustrations/references/ips/linux/`.
- Linux Mascot source and uploaded-image authority: `skills/visual-ip-illustrations/references/ips/linux/source.md`.

## Legacy Path Availability

Root Xiaohei reference paths remain available during migration and point to canonical pack files:

- `references/style-dna.md` -> `references/ips/xiaohei/style-dna.md`
- `references/xiaohei-ip.md` -> `references/ips/xiaohei/xiaohei-ip.md`
- `references/composition-patterns.md` -> `references/ips/xiaohei/composition-patterns.md`
- `references/prompt-template.md` -> `references/ips/xiaohei/prompt-template.md`
- `references/qa-checklist.md` -> `references/ips/xiaohei/qa-checklist.md`

## Output Paths

## Shared Canvas Contract

All newly generated route outputs use the shared 9:16 vertical phone-first canvas contract in `mobile-reading.md`. Any route-local 16:9 or horizontal wording is legacy calibration only and does not control new output aspect ratios.

- `xiaohei` output directory remains `assets/<article-slug>-illustrations/`; validation also keeps escaped marker `assets/&lt;article-slug&gt;-illustrations/`.
- `xiaohei` filenames continue to use ordered English slugs such as `01-topic-name.png`.
- `littlebox` output directory is `assets/<article-slug>-littlebox/`; validation also keeps escaped marker `assets/&lt;article-slug&gt;-littlebox/`.
- `littlebox` filenames use ordered English slugs such as `01-topic-name.png`.

- `hermes` output directory is `assets/<article-slug>-hermes/`; validation also keeps escaped marker `assets/&lt;article-slug&gt;-hermes/`.
- `hermes` filenames use ordered English slugs such as `01-topic-name.png`.
- `linux` output directory is `assets/<article-slug>-linux/`; validation also keeps escaped marker `assets/&lt;article-slug&gt;-linux/`.
- `linux` filenames use ordered English slugs such as `01-topic-name.png`.
- Mixed-IP requests split by IP into separate route groups: `xiaohei` 写入 `assets/<article-slug>-illustrations/`, `littlebox` 写入 `assets/<article-slug>-littlebox/`, `tom` 写入 `assets/<article-slug>-tom/`, `ferris` 写入 `assets/<article-slug>-ferris/`, `seal` writes to `assets/<article-slug>-seal/`, `openclaw` writes to `assets/<article-slug>-openclaw/`, `gopher` writes to `assets/<article-slug>-gopher/`, `caixukun` writes to `assets/<article-slug>-caixukun/`, `hermes` writes to `assets/<article-slug>-hermes/`, and `linux` writes to `assets/<article-slug>-linux/`.
- Before output, inspect the target directory and choose a new filename to preserve historical results.

## Delivery Report Fields

Each generated-image delivery states:

- selected visual IP
- image count
- purpose per image
- saved path
- stability notes: strongest images and optional images
- sequence order and role per image
- mobile-reading status: label count, longest label, and shared mobile-reading QA result
